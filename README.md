A classic Snake Game created with the purpose of learning JavaScript

I've been learning JavaScript for web development but I would like to create and code a proper game at some point during my journey, the classic Snake Game, being one of the easiest kinds of games to program in every language (that I have learnt so far) is a good place to start.

The components of a game are:
- Objective
- Interaction
- Entertainment

With these three componenets, a program can call itself a game. The objective of the Snake Game, in this case, will be to reach the highest score possible. The interaction consists of the commands the user gives to the snake in order for it to move around in the canvas and collect fruits for score. The entertainment comes with the objective, in this case, by making the highscore higher and higher.
